            <h2 id="what">What is a Regional Coordinator</h2>
              <p>
                  A regional coordinator is a central role serving a global community of Mozillians dedicated to teaching the web. There will be about 10 of us this quarter, working closely together with the Mozilla Clubs team to be gracious conveners and authentic learners. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Our goal is to support club captains to teach the web in a locally relevant and sustained way. We are in service to club captains becoming better champions and facilitators of web literacy. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  Moreover, since this is the first time we are trying out this project, our roles will be full of reflection, experimentation and documentation. We not only want to build out this aspect of the program together, we want to help others take on these roles effectively. 
              </p>
              <p>              
              A Regional Coordinator is *not* running lots of clubs. Instead, you are recruiting, on-boarding, and sustaining club captains to achieve positive outcomes, a sense of community and purpose, and to further web literacy in the world.
              </p>                  
              <p>
                  Our club captains' success is our success. 
              </p>
